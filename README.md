# HANG IN THERE

Our first pair project - making an interactive webpage showing and saving randomized motivational posters!

## DESCRIPTION

Anyone can access our page seeking a motivational boost! We have dozens of inspiring images, titles, and quotes randomly generated, or you can use our form to create your own personalized poster. Each uploaded picture, title, quote is stored in our database for others to use, so please contribute to our motivational cause!

## USEAGE

1. On webpage load, you are greeted by a randomized poster with an inspiring message.
2. To make a new poster, click the button "Show Another Random Poster".
3. To create your own motivational poster, click the "Make Your Own Poster" button and input your image link, title, and text. When complete, click "Show My Poster", and if you decide against creating your own, click "Nevermind, Take Me Back!"
4. To save your selection, click the "Save This Poster" button.
5. To view your saved selections, click the "Show Saved Posters" button. If you would like to remove a selection, simply double-click the poster and the image will be removed!

## SUPPORT

If you need help, simply try clicking wildly and repeatedly across the screen until the desired action occurs. That's what we did!

Or, you can email Alice at aliceruppert@gmail.com for an eventual fix in an undetermined timeframe.

## CONTRIBUTING

If you would like to contribute to our mission of delivering inspiring posters to anyone and everyone, please join our team! Everyone is welcome, and when you create your own poster your images, titles, and quotes are all each added to our database for others to use!
